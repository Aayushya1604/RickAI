# RickAI
RickAI is a Facebook Messenger chatbot that uses AI to generate quotes/advice based on a character named Rick from the TV show 'Rick and Morty.'

## Inspiration
After catching up with the latest season of the show, I was sad to hear that
I'll have to wait a while for the next season. So I decided to create a simple chatbot that generates quotes/advice based on one
of the shows' scientist's previous dialogs. 
 


## Technologies and Implementation
RickAI is built using JavaScript in a Node.js environment and the Wit.ai Facebook API.
The quotes/advice are generated using the Markov chain to the 5th order.
The app is deployed on Glitch.
